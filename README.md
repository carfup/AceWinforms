Ace is an embeddable code editor with syntax highlighting. You can find out more about it here: 
  http://ace.c9.io/#nav=about

This project shows how to host the Ace editor in a regular C# Winforms app. ACE is supposed to  be used in a web page, but this source will show you how to use in regular C# Winforms.

Why do this? Because it's hard to find a free WinForms editor control with a BSD license. The ace javascript library, and this user control are both BSD.

Here is a screenshot of Winforms sample app:
